# Graph Algorithm Visualiser

A visualiser which displays the process of graph algorithms on complete graphs such as: Prim's, Kruskal's, Graham Scan, Nearest Neighbour and 2-Opt. The project was primarily a learning tool to help me improve my ability using JavaScript and better understand graph algorithms.
