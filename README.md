<h1>Graph Algorithm Visualiser</h1>

Web application which visualises the process of various graph algorithms on randomised nodes. The application can simulate Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm for constructing minimum spanning trees, Graham scan to construct convex hulls, Greedy algorithm to construct minimal matchings, and Nearest neighbour with 2-Opt to create Hamiltonian cycles.

## Algorithms
- **Graham Scan** - Convex Hull
- **Prim's** - Minimum Spanning Tree
- **Kruskal's** - Minimum Spanning Tree
- **Greedy** - Minimal Matching
- **Nearest Neighbour** - Hamiltonian Path
- **Nearest Neighbour with 2-Opt** - Hamiltonian Path
- **Random Tour** - Hamiltonian Path
